# An example of a simple implementation of objects in pure C (ANSI)
This program is written for a general understanding of how objects can be implemented in pure C. The project contains header files with descriptions of objects and source files with the implementation of the internal mechanism.

All objects are packaged in the liboop_in_c library and in the future the project can be maintained without source files. This is done in order to show how the mechanisms of an object can be hidden from the user
